        <h2>The bustling streets of Rousse</h2>
        <p>
            Rousse, a bustling modern jewel in Eastern Europe, showcases wide boulevards adorned with sleek storefronts and lively cafes. In this cosmopolitan atmosphere, Sasho Stanchev discreetly wields influence, intricately entwined with the city's commerce and culture.

        <h2>A warehouse on the outskirts of Rousse</h2>
        <p>
          Nestled on the city's outskirts, an abandoned warehouse stands as a
          silent sentinel. Inside, dust motes dance in the dim light, casting
          shadows across stacks of crates. This desolate outpost serves as the
          nerve center of Stanchev's drug distribution network.

        <h2>The old fortress overlooking the Danube River</h2>
        <p>
          Perched along the Danube River, the old fortress commands a panoramic
          view of Rousse. Its ancient walls and turrets bear testament to
          centuries of history. Amidst its timeless beauty, the final
          confrontation between Stanchev and Detective Blagoev unfolds.

        <h2>The Prison</h2>
        <p>
          Tucked away on the city's outskirts, Rousse's most formidable prison
          stands as a solemn reminder of justice. Its imposing walls encase
          those within in a fortress of cold, unyielding stone. Within his cell,
          Stanchev paces restlessly, resigned to a future shrouded in
          uncertainty.
